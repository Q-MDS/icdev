1. Load a terminal in the folder
2. Run: node server
3. Load index.htm in a browser
4. Enter from, to & date -> click Run Capture

Notes: 
- Current run_capture.php returns an array with the resulting data so the console log will show an error. With run_capture_old.php does an echo json_encode which will be console friendly.
