It sounds like Puppeteer is having trouble finding the Chrome executable in your Docker setup. Here are a few steps you can try to resolve this issue:

1. Install Chrome: Make sure you have installed Chrome in your Docker container. You can do this by adding the necessary commands to your Dockerfile. For example:

Dockerfile
----------
FROM node:latest
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y wget
RUN wget https://dl.google.com/linux/direct/google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb
RUN apt-get install -y ./google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb

2.Set the Cache Path: Ensure that the cache path for Puppeteer is correctly configured. You can set the cache path in your Puppeteer script:

Javascript
----------
const puppeteer = require('puppeteer');
puppeteer.launch({ 
  executablePath: '/usr/bin/google-chrome',
  cachePath: '/path/to/cache' 
});

3. Verify Installation: Check if Chrome is installed correctly in your Docker container by running:

Sh
--
google-chrome --version
This should return the version of Chrome installed.

4. Permissions: Ensure that the user running the Docker container has the necessary permissions to access the Chrome executable and cache path.
