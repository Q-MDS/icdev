Keith changes:
1. If in split screen and you do a remove then arrival/dept board lands up in only 1 side -> on my PC now when it switches back to the arrivals and departures screen, it's only showing it on the right hand side of my screen
2.
function get_tv_list()
{
        global $conn, $branch, $tv_list;
        if (AllowedFlag("DEVELOPERS"))
          $sql = "SELECT * FROM DEPARTURE_TVS WHERE IS_ACTIVE = 1";
        else
          $sql = "SELECT * FROM DEPARTURE_TVS WHERE BRANCH = '$branch' AND IS_ACTIVE = 1"; (edited)

please add this in so that our IT staff can see ALL the TVs on the tv_route/index.php page
also remember to ORDER it alphabetically

3. and the dropdown with the route numbers ORDER by route_no
11:47
select route_no, description from route_Details where date_from<=20241119 and date_to>=20241119
and sub_route_one is null and sub_route_two is null
and route_Serial in (
select route_serial
from route_stops
where short_name='BELLVILLE' and date_from<=20241119 and date_to>=20241119
) order by route_no
;
-> I've added in the 'sub_route_one is null ' and 'sub_route_two is null' in the query from yesterday - this will remove some more 'junk' from the list
