- Budget changes
notes from budget code:   
(âˆš) transfer_date is only storing the date, not the time.      
- there are transfers being logged for amounts like  0.0010500000207685 - 
- I think you should round all budget amounts and YTD spend to the nearest cent before comparing them, please.      Thanks!
