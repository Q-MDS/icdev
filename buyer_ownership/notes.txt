Fixes 11-11-2024
√ 1. Clean up commented code
√ 2. Take ownership not working - check_faults_fixed by removing underscore: $data_["PR_SERIAL"]
√ 3. Instead of strtotime(date("Y-m-d H:i:s")); use time()
√ 4. Remove else on line 433
√ 5. Also would be nice to have 'take ownership' button to show to the buyers while viewing the PR as well - not just in the inbox.
   - if (($rights["BUYER"] || $rights["DEVELOPERS"]) && ($entry["BUYER_REQUESTED_DATE"] != "" && $entry["BUYER_OWNER_DATE"] == ""))
   - if storeman clicks on buyer action required it is added to the list 
   - if the user is the buyer they will see the BUYER: TAKE OWNERSHIP button
   - if they click on that the it moved to bottom list on buyer inbox and the button goes away
√ 6. Add notes for buyer action requires and took ownership

Hi - I'm clicking on 'take ownership' but nothing is happening
strtotime(date("Y-m-d H:i:s"));    ->  rather just say time();
the value of $req is missing
Remove else on line 433

- buyer ownership: 
  > Buyer inbox only shown to buyers ? - Check Keith answer - Y
  > Change - must be Take Over
  > Why so many records?
