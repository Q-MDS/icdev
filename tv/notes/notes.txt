- TV's in 2 stations, tv will send url + variable saying which TV it is eg JHB1
- Boarding gate needs: Route number and description
- Arrival boards: url has digits at the end which is the stop (Brllvile in the pic).
- Create table: DEPARTURE_TVS - Static data - Holds list of TV's and location
  - SCREEN_ID - NUMBER - UNIQUE/PRIMARY KEY
  - NAME - VC2(10) - eg ct1 / ct2 / jhb1 � the name used in the URL the TV calls
  - BRANCH - VC(20) eg JNB Station � from select branch_name from branch_info where is_dealer='N' order by 1; 
  - STOP_SERIAL - NUMBER eg 219 for JNB Station

- Create table: DEPARTURE_TV_SETTINGS
  - SCREEN_ID - NUMBER - 
  - BRAND - CHAR(2) - e.g.  IM   /  BI  /  IC  -> this determines the logo at the top.  route_details.carrier_code
  - ROUTE_NO - CHAR(4)
  - ROUTE_DESCRIPTION VC2(100)

PROCESS
The TV checks every 30 seconds for data/what to display. If it is OFFLINE, it must display "Please check back later".
Suggestion: On initial call get the screen_id and data which is a heavy db lookup and then use the screen_id in api call (async)
If no settings (guessing boarding data) then fetch the arrival/departure data and display.
Arrival/departure also has a refresh every 30 seconds so I'm guessing if it finds boarding daat then switch to boarding display which is shown until bus has left and settings is cleared

Office Management Tool
- Mobile friendly
- User logs in and are returned the list of TV's for their branch (looked up via in db on login - select branch from user_Details where is_current=�Y� and username=�$user�)
- User select TV and sees the following form:
  - TV Name eg. JHB1
  - Input field/search/dropdown of routes
    - If input is empty then button is ADD
    - If something is there then REMOVE
  - select carrier_code,route_no,description from route_details where date_to>=20241023 and date_from<=20241023; 

IT MANAGEMENT TOOLS
- CRUD for DEPARTURE_TVS_TABLE - Dev as standalone...

Process
- 1 html layout for boarding - add 30 second refresh - use returned data (BRAND) to decide which logo to show
- 1 html layout for arrivals - add 30 second refresh

- api: receives url (https://secure.intercape.co.za/g.php?ct1), checks DEPARTURE_TVS for the screen_id WHERE NAME = ct1 (passed in URL). Then use the DEPARTURE_TV_SETTINGS to get data for that TV. If no data is found then get the arrival data for that branch (get from DEPARTURE_TVS)
- if TV must display the arrival data a new api call is made with the station id in the url params


Need info/questions/unknowns
1. Where do I get the arrival data
2. Must I create the arrival screen?

POA
- add 30 second timer
- do function to do api call
