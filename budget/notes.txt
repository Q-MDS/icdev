Tables used:
1. PURCHASE_BUDGET


Step 1:
- Get buget amounts:
  - Fin year runs from June to May
  - Query get sum of serial (budget item) for the fin year range
  - select serial, sum(amount)  from purchase_budget where rundate in ('062024','072024','082024','092024','102024','112024','122024') group by serial

Step 2:
- Find out how much has been spent on each budget (excl current month)
  - select budget,sum(total) from purchase_running6 where budget_month in ('202406','202407','202408','202409','202410','202411','202412') group by budget
    - *** purchase_running6 is a VIEW

Step 3:
- Get budget total - budget used = x, if x < buget_total => include in dataset, also include the difference

Step 4:
- Remove from previous month and add onto new month
  - Update purchase_budget set amount=amount-2000 where serial=11932 and rundate=’122024’;  // Note: make sure you don’t take more than there is..
  - Update purchase_budget set amount=amount+2000 where serial=11932 and rundate=’012025’;

  (please check that both queries are successful, and then COMMIT, otherwise ROLLBACK)

Overall: 
- Log all actions taken to a txt file and email to me and Keith  
   - e.g. Fleet Maintenance – Parts (RSA) - R 2000 moved from 2024/12 to 2025/01
   - To get the budget name: select name from purchase_budget_names where serial='11932';
- Note that when this runs in June, it must do nothing, because it’s the beginning of the financial year and you may not move budget from a previous financial year.
  - In the code add a check: if Month is != 06 then you can start
