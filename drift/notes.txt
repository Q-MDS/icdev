Hi

Here's the changes discussed on DRIFT dashboard

√. Add hide/show button to "hide" inputs from totals page.
√. Change names : Active drivers to Skilled Drivers and Training to Drivers on Training Trips.
   - data for Drivers on Training Trips is not coming from depot_totals !!!
√. Delete able to schedule row. Now use new skilled drivers for the calculation on Still Needed - MIN.

√. Amend hover query to the following
SELECT DISTINCT
    DEPOT,
    UPPER(STAFFNO || ' - ' || NAME || ' ' || SURNAME || ' - ' || TO_DATE(MAX_RUNDATE,'YYYYMMDD')) DRIVER
FROM HC_PEOPLE A
LEFT JOIN
    (SELECT DISTINCT
        SERIAL_NO
    FROM OPS_INFO
    WHERE ENTRY_TYPE = 'o'
        AND TO_DATE(RUNDATE,'YYYYMMDD') > SYSDATE - 3
        AND TO_DATE(RUNDATE,'YYYYMMDD') <= SYSDATE) B
    ON A.PERSON_SERIAL = B.SERIAL_NO
LEFT JOIN
    (SELECT
        SERIAL_NO,
        MAX(RUNDATE) MAX_RUNDATE
    FROM OPS_INFO
    WHERE ENTRY_TYPE = 'o'
    GROUP BY SERIAL_NO) C
    ON A.PERSON_SERIAL = C.SERIAL_NO
WHERE
    ACTIVE != 'N'
    AND UPPER(ORG_UNIT) LIKE '%OPS DRIVER%'
    AND DEPOT != 'GON'
    AND DEPOT != 'INC'
    AND DEPOT != 'XXX'
    AND B.SERIAL_NO IS NULL;

√. Add the who changed what and when columns to DRIFT_DEPOT_TOTALS to be able to see history
√. Add the who changed what and when columns to DRIFT_PARAMETERS table.
  - tables: DEPOTS, DUAL, DRIFT_PARAMETERS, drift_parameter_dates
  - must create a new table or add a record
  
7. Only include org_unit = 'Ops Drivers' to the totals displayed here
  - Is this the results forxxx on december xxxx
  - Is it all 4 totals
8. On the summary tab can we please show Permanent and Fixed term split, not just the totals
- which total must be split? Drivers on sops, minimum drivers needed?

SQL to get percentage splits for SOPS effects
SELECT A.scenario_no, B.PERCENTAGE_FIXEDTERM, B.PERCENTAGE_LEARNERSHIP, B.PERCENTAGE_PERMANENT FROM DRIFT_RUN A, DRIFT_PARAMETERS B WHERE A.run_id = '53572' AND a.scenario_no = b.parameter_serial
