Hi

Here's the changes discussed on DRIFT dashboard

√. Add hide/show button to "hide" inputs from totals page.
√. Change names : Active drivers to Skilled Drivers and Training to Drivers on Training Trips.
   - data for Drivers on Training Trips is not coming from depot_totals !!!
√. Delete able to schedule row. Now use new skilled drivers for the calculation on Still Needed - MIN.

√. Amend hover query to the following
SELECT DISTINCT
    DEPOT,
    UPPER(STAFFNO || ' - ' || NAME || ' ' || SURNAME || ' - ' || TO_DATE(MAX_RUNDATE,'YYYYMMDD')) DRIVER
FROM HC_PEOPLE A
LEFT JOIN
    (SELECT DISTINCT
        SERIAL_NO
    FROM OPS_INFO
    WHERE ENTRY_TYPE = 'o'
        AND TO_DATE(RUNDATE,'YYYYMMDD') > SYSDATE - 3
        AND TO_DATE(RUNDATE,'YYYYMMDD') <= SYSDATE) B
    ON A.PERSON_SERIAL = B.SERIAL_NO
LEFT JOIN
    (SELECT
        SERIAL_NO,
        MAX(RUNDATE) MAX_RUNDATE
    FROM OPS_INFO
    WHERE ENTRY_TYPE = 'o'
    GROUP BY SERIAL_NO) C
    ON A.PERSON_SERIAL = C.SERIAL_NO
WHERE
    ACTIVE != 'N'
    AND UPPER(ORG_UNIT) LIKE '%OPS DRIVER%'
    AND DEPOT != 'GON'
    AND DEPOT != 'INC'
    AND DEPOT != 'XXX'
    AND B.SERIAL_NO IS NULL;

5. Add the who changed what and when columns to DRIFT_DEPOT_TOTALS to be able to see history
6. Add the who changed what and when columns to DRIFT_PARAMETERS table.
7. Only include org_unit = 'Ops Drivers' to the totals displayed here

8. On the summary tab can we please show Permanent and Fixed term split, not just the totals.
