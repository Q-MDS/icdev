V2
- user logs in to page.
  - look for current bulletin record from MTR
    -- Found = display
	-- NOT Found
	   - Create MTR record
	     -- √ mtr_id, 
			? MTR_REF_MOVE_TECH_BULLETINS, - bulletin ID - FETCH MTB RECORD
			  -- Fetch MTB record
			     - SELECT * FROM MTB WHERE mtb_use_date = $monday
				  - FOUND RECORD
				    -- Return data;
				  - NO RECORD FOUND
				    -- SELECT MTB_ID FROM MTB ORDER BY id, priority LIMIT 1
					   - Use MTN_ID to set the mtb_use_date = $monday
					   - Return inserted MTB_ID + Data
			? mtr_revision,  - FETCH MTB RECORD
			√ mtr_ref_hc_people, - passed $user_id
			√ mtr_status, 0 for Needs to read
			√ mtr_date_start - will be $monday
	-- Present MTR data in banner
	   

- Manage bulletins console - MTB's
  -- List of MTB's - MTB_ID, MTB_NAME, MTB_URL, MTB_DATE, MTB_REVISION, MTB_STATUS, MTB_USE_DATE : Status = 0 - deleted, 1 - current, 2 - priority; perhaps add intranet bulletin table id as a table field - WHERE status != 0
     -- E   |   D   |   Added   |   Name + Link   |   Revision   |   Priority
  -- Add - need to retrieve list from Intranet bulletin table (id + name + url)
         - Copy name from select to the name input - user can edit name
         - revision - if already in list then increase by 1
		 - priority Y/N
  -- Edit - Can only really set the priority

  - Will need to see if the MTB_ID is in the MTR table - if so then edit and delete are affected
